   This script takes mushcode and attempts to make it more readable
   by splitting single lines across multiple lines. Various arbitrary
   rules are used to split up commands and functions.

   Conversion back into a MUSH appropriate form is supported and is
   done so without loss of characters from the original. I.e. If the
   mushcode is "formated" and then "unformated", the output should be
   the same as the original mushcode.

   Command line usage may be optained by running this script without any
   arguements.
